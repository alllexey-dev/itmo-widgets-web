# Web app architecture

How the web app in `web/` is put together: routing, the session, the API client,
the feature layout, tests and the bundle. The visual side is in
[`design.md`](design.md); the backend contracts are `docs/contracts/web.md` and
`docs/contracts/admin.md` in `itmo-widgets-backend`.

## Serving

The app is a single-page app built by Vite with `base: '/app/'`. The root
`Dockerfile` builds it on `node:22-alpine` and copies `dist/` into
`/usr/share/nginx/html/app` of the landing's `nginx:alpine` image.
`deploy/site.nginx.conf` falls back to `/app/index.html` for any `/app/*` path
without a file (`Cache-Control: no-cache`) and caches the hashed
`/app/assets/` for a year. `nginx-hub` routes `/api/` of the same domain to
Backend, so the app and the API share one origin: no CORS and a same-site cookie.

In development Vite serves `http://localhost:5173/app/` and proxies `/api` to
`https://dev.widgets.alllexey.dev` (`vite.config.ts`).

## Routing

`App` wraps everything in `AppProviders` (theme, TanStack Query, toasts) and a
`BrowserRouter` whose `basename` is `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` without the
trailing slash. Routes live in `src/app/routes.tsx`:

| Path                  | Page                            | Access      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `/login`              | `LoginPage` (outside the shell) | anyone      |
| `/`                   | `HomePage`                      | signed in   |
| `/admin/moderation`   | `ModerationPage`                | `moderator` |
| `/admin/restrictions` | `RestrictionsPage`              | `moderator` |
| `/admin/dashboard`    | `DashboardPage`                 | `admin`     |
| `/admin/users`        | `UsersPage`                     | `admin`     |
| `/admin/users/:isu`   | `UserPage`                      | `admin`     |
| `/admin/sport`        | `SportPage`                     | `admin`     |
| `/admin/system`       | `SystemPage`                    | `admin`     |
| `/admin/reviews`      | `ReviewsPage`                   | `admin`     |
| `/admin/audit`        | `AuditPage`                     | `admin`     |
| `*`                   | `NotFoundPage` (in the shell)   | signed in   |

`Shell` is the layout route: sidebar, top bar with the account menu, and an
`<Outlet>` rendered only after the session loads. Below 760 px the sidebar
becomes a drawer with a scrim, a focus trap and Esc to close.

`RequireAccess` is a layout route around each protected group. Without the
access it renders `ForbiddenPage` (`Нет доступа`) instead of the outlet, so the
page makes no requests. The sidebar comes from `NAV_GROUPS` in
`src/app/navigation.ts`, filtered by the same rule; a group without visible
items is hidden.

Page state that should survive a reload or a shared link lives in the query
string through `useSearchParams`: moderation `status`, `reason`, `page`, `case`;
restrictions `isu`, `all`, `page`; users `q`, `page`; audit `page`. Selecting a
case replaces the history entry instead of pushing one.

## Session

- `useSessionQuery()` loads `GET /api/web/auth/me` (`isu`, `name`, `pictureUrl`,
  `groups`, `roles`) with a 5-minute stale time and no retry.
- `Shell` provides the result through `SessionContext`; pages call
  `useSession()`, which throws outside the shell.
- `hasAccess(session, 'user' | 'moderator' | 'admin')` is the only role rule:
  `ADMIN` implies moderator rights. `useAccess(access)` wraps it for components.
  The backend enforces access; the UI only hides.
- `SessionLostRedirect` subscribes to `onSessionLost` from the API client. When a
  request answers 401, or `/api/web/auth/me` answers 403, it drops the session
  query and navigates to `/login` without a reload. The login page checks the
  session itself, so a failed check there is ignored.
- `useLogout()` posts `/api/web/auth/logout`, clears the whole query cache and
  navigates to `/login`.

### Phone sign-in

`LoginPage` redirects to `/` when a session exists. Otherwise
`useLoginChallenge` in `src/features/auth/`:

1. creates a challenge once on mount (`POST /api/web/auth/challenges`);
2. computes a local deadline from `expiresAt`, falling back to 2 minutes when
   the browser clock disagrees with the server (lifetime not in 0–10 minutes);
3. polls `GET /api/web/auth/challenges/{id}` with `X-Poll-Secret` every 2 s
   while the tab is visible (`usePageVisible`) and the deadline has not passed;
   returning to the tab polls at once;
4. replaces a code that expired, answered `EXPIRED` or 404, at most 5 times in
   a row (about 12 minutes, below the backend limit of 10 codes per address in
   10 minutes), then shows `Код устарел` with `Показать новый код`;
5. on `APPROVED` resets the session query and navigates to `/`.

Polling stops on the local deadline; the backend's extra minute for claiming a
late approval is not used. `?code=` on `/login` (a QR opened by a phone camera)
shows the code with a hint to enter it in the app. The QR encodes
`${origin}/app/login?code=<code>`; `parseLoginCode` accepts only the backend
alphabet.

## API client

All HTTP goes through `src/api/client.ts`:

- `api.get/post/put/patch/delete<T>(path, …)` over `apiRequest`, with
  `credentials: 'same-origin'`, `Accept: application/json`, JSON bodies and a
  `query` object (empty values are dropped).
- Every non-GET request carries `X-Web-Request: 1`, which Backend requires for
  cookie sessions (CSRF, answer `403 csrf` otherwise).
- The `ApiResponse` envelope `{success, data, error: {message, code}}` is
  unwrapped; the promise resolves with `data`.
- Failures throw `ApiError(message, status, code)` with helpers `isUnauthorized`
  (401), `isForbidden` (403) and `isNetwork` (status 0). Aborts rethrow the
  `AbortError` untouched.

Error codes:

| Code                | Source                          | Text (`src/api/errors.ts`)                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `network`           | client, fetch failed (status 0) | `Нет соединения с сервером`                |
| `http_error`        | client, non-envelope failure    | the caller's fallback                      |
| `permission_denied` | Backend 403                     | `Недостаточно прав`                        |
| `not_found`         | Backend 404                     | `Не найдено`                               |
| `rate_limited`      | Backend 429                     | `Слишком много запросов, попробуйте позже` |
| `csrf`              | Backend 403                     | `Обновите страницу и попробуйте снова`     |

`errorText(error, fallback, overrides)` picks the override for the code, then
the table, then the fallback; pages pass overrides such as
`invalid_request_data` → `Проверьте пороги`. Backend messages are English and
technical and are never shown.

`createQueryClient()` sets the defaults: queries are fresh for 30 s, do not
refetch on focus, and retry at most twice, only for network failures and 5xx;
mutations never retry.

## Features layout

```text
src/
  app/        App, providers, routes, Shell, AccountMenu, navigation, RequireAccess,
              ForbiddenPage, NotFoundPage, queryClient
  api/        client.ts, errors.ts, admin.ts (AdminPage {items, page, size, total},
              shared admin shapes)
  features/
    auth/       login page, challenge hook, session, QR, countdown
    home/       HomePage
    moderation/ queue, case detail, decision dialogs, shortcuts, restrictions
    users/      users list, user page, moderator role switch
    dashboard/  DashboardPage, lazy TrendChart
    system/     SportPage, SystemPage (app version, moderation settings)
    reviews/    ReviewsPage (reviews sync state and start)
    audit/      AuditPage
  ui/         design system (see design.md)
  test/       Vitest setup, MSW server and handlers, synthetic admin data, render helpers
```

A feature keeps its pages, `api.ts` (query keys, `useQuery`/`useMutation`
hooks), `types.ts` (wire shapes from the backend contract), `labels.ts`
(Russian names, icons, badge tones) and CSS Modules together; tests sit next to
the code as `*.test.tsx`. Features import from `src/ui`, `src/api` and
`features/auth` for the session; `home` reads the open-case count from
`moderation`.

Query keys start with the area (`['admin', 'moderation', …]`,
`['admin', 'users', …]`, `['admin', 'audit', …]`), so a mutation invalidates a
whole area at once. A moderation decision writes the returned case into the
cache and invalidates the rest of the area; a role change also invalidates the
audit log. Paged lists keep the previous page on screen while the next loads.
The next case in the queue is prefetched. The reviews sync state
(`['admin', 'reviews', 'sync']`) is polled every 3 s while a run is in
progress; a start writes the returned state into the cache and invalidates the
audit log, and a rejected start (409) refetches the state.

## Testing

Vitest runs in jsdom with `src/test/setup.ts`:

- `server` from `src/test/server.ts` is an MSW node server started with
  `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'`, so every request a test makes must be mocked.
  Handlers are reset, `localStorage` cleared and `data-theme` removed after each
  test. `fetch` is never stubbed directly.
- Helpers: `ok(data)` and `fail(status, code)` build backend envelopes;
  `sessionOf(roles)`, `mockSession`, `mockSignedOut` (403 on `/me`, like the
  backend); `mockChallenges` and `mockPoll` for sign-in (a wrong poll secret is
  404); `mockOpenCases`.
- `src/test/admin.ts` holds synthetic admin data and handlers that filter and
  page like the backend (`pageOf`). No real accounts.
- `renderApp(route)` renders the real routes inside `AppProviders` and a
  `MemoryRouter`, so tests go through the shell, the session and access checks;
  `renderWithProviders(ui)` renders one component.
- CSS Modules use non-scoped class names in tests.
- Queries go by role and accessible name; one concept per test,
  Arrange-Act-Assert; private helpers are not tested.

Before calling work done:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
```

## Bundle

`npm run build` type-checks and emits one entry chunk with React, React Router,
TanStack Query, `qrcode` and every page, plus one CSS file. recharts is about as
large as the rest of the app together, so `DashboardPage` loads `TrendChart`
with `React.lazy` inside `Suspense` (a skeleton while it loads) and recharts
lands in its own chunk that only the dashboard downloads. Other pages are not
split. Material Symbols Rounded comes from Google Fonts; `public/theme-init.js`
runs before the bundle to apply a saved theme without a flash.
